This will be a documentation for all the scripts in this directory 
and associated generated data files:

Scripts/Code

buildTabs.R:         takes in the tables created by the outputs of readCov.py 
		     and also the tables SNP tables generated by Chris and 
		     merges them into one large table giving SNP and coverage
		     informatio n for each position of the genome. 

errorPlotsWLR.R:     code sent by WLR. Should be deprecated for his code 
		     located in the Scripts directory of the snpNB package

error.R:	     code that generates some summary statistics and fitting
		     the goodness to fit test

multipleAlleles.R:   code to see if how many mismatches from the reference
		     exceed more than $k$. For instance, let $k$ = 5 and 
		     the reference be "A". Then if there are more than 5 
		     reads covering "G" and "T", the code returns 2 for 
		     that position. 

readCounts.R:	     code that generates the plots for the coverage data
		     right now for the desert. It's in disarray and needs 
		     to be fixed asap. 

readCov.py:	     python code that takes a m-pileup and generates 
		     the coverage statistics for a genome based on the read
		     data    

snpCoverage: 	     code sent by WLR. should be deprecated

mpileup_samtools.py: script that will generate an mpileup file from a
		     .BAM file	    

mplieup_gen*.sh:     shell script that will call the mpileup*.py
		     script on the various .BAM files and generate
		     the mpileup files


Data

full.tables.rda:     These are the full tables of all seven strains
		     generated by the buildTabs.R scritpt. The	
		     rows indicate the "positions" and there are 13
		     columns: 
		  chr  pos snp  Chr  Pos Ref2 Cov  a  g  c  t n .match 
		     The chr/Chr give the Chromosome (merging check)
		     The pos/Pos give the position (merging check)
		     The Ref2 gives the reference nucleotide per 1335
		     The .match = read coverage matching the ref
		     The {a,g,c,t,n} = read coverage mis-matching ref
full.*des.rda: 	     full.tables restricted to the 320KB desert in 
		     Chr 1
full.*Chr1.rda:	     full.tables restricted to Chr 1 
ftdp.rda:	     full.tables restricted to the 320KB desert +
		     100KB to the 3' 
point5.rda:	     full.tables restricted to where |nonref|/|cov|
		     is greater than 0.5

gof.results.rda:     Goodness of fit test results using only coverage
gof.ref*.rda:	     Goodness of fit test results using cov/ref
		     alleles
multAlleles.rda:     Table that counts the number of positions that 
		     have >5 reads mapping to .match and at >5...,50
		     reads mapping to at least two nonref bases. Used
		     the full.tables.rda to generate.
multAllelesP5.rda:   Same as multAlleles but using point5.rda
